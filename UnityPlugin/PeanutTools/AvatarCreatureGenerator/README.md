# AvatarCreature Generator

A Unity plugin to create an assetbundle for use in the AvatarCreature Lethal Company mod.

## Usage

1. Duplicate your Unity project (this is very important)
2. Import the `.unitypackage`
3. Go to PeanutTools -> AvatarCreature Generator in the menu
4. Drag your avatar into the slot
5. Enter your Steam ID (number)
6. Enter your Lethal Company installation folder (inside `steamapps/common`)
7. Click Generate

Share your generated assetbundle (eg. `123456.assetbundle`) with your friends so they can see your avatar if they have the mod.
