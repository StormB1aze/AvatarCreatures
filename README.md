# AvatarCreatures

A Lethal Company mod that lets you load custom avatars for players in your lobby.

Each player must have the assetbundle for each player to see them properly:

1. Use the Unity plugin to generate an assetbundle for your own avatar in your `steamapps/common/Lethal Company/Avatars` folder
2. Share this assetbundle with your friends (eg. `562123.assetbundle`) and make sure everyone's assetbundle is in the same "Avatars" folder
3. Run the mod and you should see them
